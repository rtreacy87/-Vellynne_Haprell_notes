        <h1>Wooden Floor Background Example</h1>
        <p>This is a simple example page that uses the wooden-floor-background.jpg image as the background.</p>
        <p>The text is displayed directly on the wooden texture background.</p>
        <p>A subtle text shadow helps improve readability against the textured background.</p>
        
        <h2>The Beauty of Wooden Floors</h2>
        <p>Wooden floors have been used in homes and buildings for centuries, providing warmth, character, and timeless appeal. The natural grain patterns and rich colors of wood create a unique aesthetic that synthetic materials simply cannot replicate.</p>
        
        <p>Each wooden floor tells a story through its knots, grain patterns, and natural imperfections. These characteristics are not flaws but rather the signature of nature's craftsmanship, making every wooden floor a one-of-a-kind masterpiece.</p>
        
        <div class="quote">
            <p>"The beauty of a wooden floor lies not in its perfection, but in its character."</p>
        </div>
        
        <h2>Types of Wood Flooring</h2>
        <p>There are numerous types of wood flooring available, each with its own unique properties and appearance:</p>
        <p><strong>Oak:</strong> Known for its durability and distinctive grain patterns, oak is one of the most popular choices for wooden flooring. It comes in two main varieties: red oak, which has a warm, reddish tone, and white oak, which has a more neutral, grayish hue.</p>
        <p><strong>Maple:</strong> With its light color and subtle grain pattern, maple provides a clean, contemporary look. It's extremely hard and durable, making it an excellent choice for high-traffic areas.</p>
        <p><strong>Cherry:</strong> Cherry wood starts with a light pinkish tone that deepens to a rich reddish-brown over time. It has a smooth, straight grain and a luxurious appearance.</p>
        <p><strong>Walnut:</strong> Dark, rich, and sophisticated, walnut flooring adds drama and elegance to any space. It's softer than oak or maple but prized for its beautiful color variations.</p>
        
        <h2>Maintaining Your Wooden Floor</h2>
        <p>Proper maintenance is essential to preserve the beauty and longevity of wooden floors. Regular sweeping or vacuuming helps remove dirt and debris that can scratch the surface. Avoid using excessive water when cleaning, as moisture can damage wood.</p>
        
        <p>Periodically, wooden floors may need to be refinished to restore their original luster. This process involves sanding down the surface to remove scratches and stains, then applying a new coat of finish to protect the wood and enhance its natural beauty.</p>
        
        <p>With proper care, a quality wooden floor can last for generations, becoming more beautiful with age as it develops a rich patina that adds character and charm to your space.</p>
        
        <h2>Environmental Considerations</h2>
        <p>When choosing wooden flooring, it's important to consider the environmental impact. Look for wood that has been harvested from sustainably managed forests, certified by organizations such as the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC).</p>
        
        <p>Reclaimed wood is another eco-friendly option, giving new life to timber salvaged from old buildings, barns, or other structures. These recycled materials often have unique characteristics and historical significance that add depth and interest to your floor.</p>

            <p>"The most sustainable floor is one that lasts for generations."</p>
        </div>
        
        <p>By choosing quality wooden flooring and maintaining it properly, you're not only creating a beautiful living space but also making a sustainable choice that can last for decades or even centuries.</p>
