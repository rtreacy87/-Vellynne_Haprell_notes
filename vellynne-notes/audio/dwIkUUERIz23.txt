Yeah.
I'm free.
I'm free.
I'm free.
Thanks, Craig.
Thanks, Craig.
Good.
Good.
We can.
Yeah.
Amber.
Logic.
And brass over yet.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
You're welcome.
You're welcome.
You're welcome.
I'll see you in the next two.
You can cast it.
This is where we're trying to recruit for.
This one is taken on.
This one's taken no damage.
This vampire has taken like,
How many I don't believe that you know all the names
Yeah, that's not your code. It's all like dirt hard wood
I can recognize them, but just now by name only since
Sponsored by litter robot
Me anyway
It is really they've got like the back to the day where like Ron Jeremy and Peter North were legit
You know
So we're like the idea of wanting to see a video with Ron Jeremy
Like we're new this is like
We're
You know
He was a what the guy is a peep show got shot. That's right
Jeremy is just as Mario though
I used to keep seeing
I was like
Yeah, Bob Austin with the fucker you do it.
Like dude, that's a bit dangerous and the intent of it's got such strong layers of my very intellectual property
That shit would have gotten suited to oblivion if he kept it up
You have to create Wario just because this happened
Yeah, right
Yeah, it was
That's a good point down
Yeah, Bob Austin's Mario
Yeah, Jeremy is Wario
I buy that. I buy that
That was my ability. No, that was Wario
Yes
I can't part of the Mario brain
It's Wario
You know why the princess keeps ending up with Wario guys I hate to say it
Wario
Wario is pecking
Because she's freak
She's freak man
It's because Wario eats ass
Yeah
And we wonder
Craig, Craig you get that
Craig yeah
My check for
Craig can you read that?
Can you read that back to the court Craig?
Oh
Right
Yeah, right in the vamp
The two vampires are up first
Oh, fun
So
Not totally shit
Yeah, vamp one is starting us off
Is that the one next to Sean or the one that's over on its end?
That is the one next to Sean
Okay, it will need to
What is that?
You're
Creature speed is how did the area
When you
Start your turn there and must make a wisdom saving throw
Or what?
On a failed save the creature takes 3d8 radiance and a successful save
It takes us or takes half as much damage
Yeah
But you are
You're
Feeding
I found out my kids are
What's the need
16
That's a pass
Pass R8
So the roll 3d8 so you can take half of that
11 so call 5
Radiant damage
I thought we were rounded up 6
Oh sure, sure if you want 6
Or be it from ink
Radiant
So she can radiance
R8
All right, so she
Feel like
Does a very classic vampire thing
It being in this radiant damage and hisses a little bit
And you see this time since she's sort of right
Right
You see is she sort of mystifies in front of your eyes
In terms of this like this sort of puff of black smoke
And then it's gone
All right
Speed is halved so she can only go so far
No, I mean wildly
Amused to find something
Did you hear that Ryan that her speed is have
Yeah, that doesn't affect spells
That's moving speed
Is that it for her turn
We'll say this that you hear another pop
Somewhere inside of the crowd
And but you can't tell from where just other than that it's
Rothbard you can you're the closest so you would hear that it's
On the map
It's west of you
And
You do hear a little bit of like you hear a sound of somebody
Like cry out
And that's it
Okay, then it's vampire 2's turn
Where we found
In this area
Yeah, like 3040
I think they feel like two or three so far
And then a few others
I mean
Say
I've never seen a pit bowl break into it
So this you have power
Yeah, we've been a Turkish friend
Yeah
Never seen one term
They're on your speed they're just 30 aren't they
We'll be two
One
Tax
Three diaries
Probably
Three diaries
I think it's
Trying to like is there a
I beat us to these nuts
So you see her
And at a reality similar to the other one
Here
Where is she?
I don't like that
I don't
And she's going to
Let's see
She gives you that she stares at you
As she comes right in front of you
And you must make a DC 15 wisdom saving through
If you're right
This is right
Oh yeah, she's
She's otherworldly hot
Nice
Well
It makes sense
Because I'm asexual
So it's a
It's a 28
Oh my god
You're like
I don't know
Nine to saving wisdom saving
Awesome
You're not
You're not
Is she attacking also or is that
Yeah, so she's going to do that and then she's going to attack you twice
She goes she's mad
So the first one is a
So 27 to attack
Yeah
Oh
Are you kidding me?
Oh shit
Are you kidding me?
Man, that's bad
That's 17 slashing damage
You think I could do one when you still rebar
I'm okay for now
I'm okay for more time
Oh, is it really doing anything right now?
The story
I assume a 23 hits
Well, yeah
Yeah, so hits
Yeah
So then she's going to do
Eight points of additional damage from you
Sex of wolves
Hold on
Be alone
Okay, no, that's good. That's it for that one
You're pretty proud
I'll be reviewing
Yeah, if you want
I promise you
Yeah
All right
And that's why she said
So she's going to disengage from you and just move away
Not disengage, but she's going to move away even if she takes the hack of opportunity
I'm not going to
Okay
I can't remember which cloaks
I don't expect
No, actually, I remember you saying that you put it on the moment you heard the screaming so you do have
Placement cloak on
All right, since I'm maintaining concentration on the tone of spirits
And I use an action to move that
I don't know if that's
Because I use a sorcery point to project a spell that is normally self somewhere else
You know what went requires to move it
I would assume that if he already used the sorcery point to cast it away at someone when he wasn't touching them
He doesn't have to use another sorcery point to move that
No, I'd say just move you just move it
Okay, there's a long range
Yeah, that seems like you're not fair to consume a sorcery point every time
Sure, but would that be a move action? Would that be a standard action?
That's bonus action that feels bonus action with it
Okay, well then can I spend a bonus action?
Another bonus action as an action?
What is what is the equivalency of a bonus action?
Is that a move action if I want an extra bonus action?
You can just swap a bonus action for an action that's fine
Okay
I'm going to activate radiant consumption for one minute
Ideal radiant damage equal to my proficiency to all creatures within 10 feet
And once the turn I can
And deal extra radiant damage to all creatures
I hope within a time
So if I still have movement
One, two, three, four, five
I'm going to just move right behind this vampire
Okay, I assume that's here
Yeah, sorry, I got to move my
Wait, is the hot guy the vampire or is the hot lady the vampire?
The hot lady underneath
Okay, yeah, yeah, she's a bonus
Sorry, I'm trying to
What am I doing?
Oh, sorry, focus pain guys, my apologies
Wrong thing
No, no, no, I was hand and not arrow
This is a zombie
A little bit unique
Right, we ruined everything
We're cool, we're cool
I'll be cool, yeah
Yeah, I don't know if I inflict the damage now
So it's three points of radiant damage to her
Sure, just
Yeah
Okay
Yeah, I think
I feel like I pushed it
It's Yeti one's turn
I don't remember which one that is
But anyone that's next to Vasilya Glarko
Let me think about what
Yeti one is going to do
Wait, did I do that backwards?
I think I pressed one
That looks like a J
I write it upside down
Oh, it's so mean
I did on this one
So I got a role to recharge
We're good, we're good
All right
So
Okay
So Glarko
Mm-hmm
Yeti is going to target you
With
It's called chilling gaze
You need to make a DC-18 Constitution saving throw
Sweet
Quite sharp
He's got only got
16
What was it?
AC-18
Yeah, I got 16
Fail
Let's see
That was a strength check
Constitution
Which I have plus eight and by a roll of seven
Yeah
Which actually is 15
You will take 21 cold damage
Reduced by two by your cloak
And you are paralyzed for one minute
You may repeat the save at the end of each of its turns
Of your turns
Okay
Would we know
If there was anything we could do to change that condition?
Probably
Can I use my inspiration right now?
Of course
Yes
Sweet
Last one
All right, did I went from six to none?
In like two sessions
I run it too
Oh
I'm sorry I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm gonna DM magic this
You can't roll lower on inspiration dice
That's you can't put me this way as you roll lower
Yeah, that's terrible
I'm gonna take it
Take it
I'm not accepting it
You have
You have
I'm not I'm not accepting it you have
You either
Have another role
All right, I'm wrong
Make the choice
Sixteen
All right
Even plus eight
Oh yeah
Okay, so you are your frozen solid now what paralyzed
No, you're see he passed
So you have the damage and you do not
I was wondering over the other
That is until hang on hang on
You just have the damage
You just have damage
So that's usually held down
You either him
Okay, so that's nine points of damage
Yeah, you think you'll think nine points
10 points of damage because it was going your
In the cloak
And then you were in the end of it's a fact that can't
Why is he or you decide you anymore
Nice
Can I take my
All reaction to that
I don't know how close he is to doing
Yeah, I'm gonna go ahead and use it
All right, what's happening is he's leaving
18
Get him moving
Oh, no, just because it attacks somebody next to
Yeah
And
Good play that would be 11 points of
Sleshing
Okay
Work
That's it for yetiones turn
Nope
It's gonna make a claw attack against Colin for having done that
I love you
It's a 23 hit
Match
Yeah hits
So that hits
That is
That is
Sorry, you gotta do math in my head 10 points of
Sleshing damage
And
Six points of cold damage
Thank you
Reduced by two
You're right, but I don't know what that again, but it fails
This is on the second try
Thank you
Is that it for that one's turn now
It's for that yeti
Is it
Is it considered stormy conditions right now?
Yes, yes
Okay, I'm gonna cast
Call lightning
No, oh, she's sorry
And
I'm gonna put it
I'm gonna put it
Off the back corner of yetione where he's the only one who's five feet
And go away from it
Okay, so that
You don't want to hit
Well, I kind of want to hit both of them, but I'm not going to do that to the ceiling
You can probably nick both of those with a hit if you're careful if you if you that you can probably them both
Yeah, okay
He's doing
There's no
Right
So all right, so first I have to first I have to move a little bit I think
Three more
Five
Here can you do you want to move me?
All right
Let me make sure the battle
The light is
Yeah, so it's a 60 foot radius cloud
That's like hovering directly over me to like one two three
Three four
Seven eight nine nine five
It's like she is too
But then I choose a point
I choose a point
Within that cloud where the lightning comes down
both of those since you're letting me do that, both of the yeties have to make a
dexterity saving throw. You see 17. Okay, so the first one fails and the
second one passes. Okay, so I will roll get an extra D10 because it's stormy.
That's all 4010. Nice. Vigil. I love it. Those villagers are going to get so
nervous with the yeti you're gone in the clouds.
Okay, so the one that failed takes 21. Nice. I have lightning damage.
Which one was that number one?
Nice. And then yeti too will take half that. So 12 I guess or 11.
Very cool. I'm really down with this. I love call lightning. It's such a great cleric spell.
Long druid spell. Divine spell, whatever.
Okay, and then with my bonus action,
I cannot. I don't think I have one of sight to yeti one.
No, you do the love yeti too. I will. So instead
two, three, four, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, so instead I will cast my
archer beam at the vampire. Okay, and that'll be a 24 to hit.
Oh, yeah, that is. Okay, and then it'll be in points of radiant damage.
Geez. And that's everything for me, which brings us to yeti too.
Yeti too. All right. Yeti too is going to try to claw the seely.
And he misses the first one. And hits on the second. I'm assuming it's 25 hits.
You were doing the right thing.
All right, that is points of of slashing damage and six points of cold.
I was a slashing. You cut out first. I 12 points.
And that's it for him.
Um, I'm going to move right up next to this vamp.
That's not. That's right. Yeah, that's not the vamp. Oh, that's okay.
Sorry. Yeah, the other hot leap. I think that works, five, ten,
twelve, twenty, twenty, twenty, twenty. Yeah.
Obviously, it's difficult to tell which one's the vampire.
They both the red background. It's like killing people up so bad.
I need to do it. Do it. Do it. Do it.
He's got his body. I mean, you know how to do that just it might have consequences.
He'll have to do almost all of them.
You have to make sure you don't forget to figure out a blanket on the vampire.
Yeah, he's. I was acting with the rapier of haste.
I think it's 16 to hit 16 on the vampire.
Yeah, that's a mess.
All right, well, I get I get a bonus hit a bonus attack since I use the rapier paste.
Yeah, I'm going to do it again. Same thing.
You got it. That's a 17.
That's a hit.
17. What? No, I'm sorry. That is that is still a mess.
All right, dude. All right, boy, I'm going to.
That's not much. That's what I'll play as a bonus.
I love it. See? Yeah.
Why don't you?
That hurts.
You heard me on.
I don't know what I think.
No strain.
I thought I'll tell you what's still a guy right now.
It's fluid. I don't know. I can just decide for yourselves.
Yeah, it's like transitional.
Like it's already at the top.
Oh, but what season are you?
I'm going to be a violent thing.
I'm a fall.
Is there anything else for you?
So I'm going to disengage.
I'm going to use my cunning action and disengage.
Move back about where I was before.
Yeah, I'm going to just move into the zone.
Inputation.
Yes, you like it.
Torian's up.
And then far, cool. You're out of deck.
Sweet. Thank you.
And you was.
Thank you.
I'm up.
Yeah. Torian is up.
I'm going to move towards you, Cassini.
I don't know where I see you're doing to me.
Just right next to you.
Like here.
Yeah.
Move Torian.
Which yet he took more damage between two and one.
One.
Oh, one last.
Do you mean line of sight then?
No.
Um, from there, I'm going to cast, um,
dissonant whispers at level two on Yeti one.
Do I need a DC 16 wisdom saving throw from Yeti?
Be a negative amount of fire.
Be a negative amount of fire.
To fail.
Yes.
All right.
Uh, so that'll be, uh, four D six psychic damage.
That's on Yeti two.
One.
Yeti one.
Right over one by the sound of an axophone.
Oh, they don't know where it's coming from.
Uh, uh, what is that?
What's going on?
I've never heard this instrument.
But all right, uh, that'll be 13 points of psychic damage.
Cause you Yeti one.
Um, I'm going to give Bartik inspiration.
Who needs it?
When I think like, give it to you.
I don't know if anyone's got a, well, that's triggering two.
Yeah, that's sure.
I got to run away.
So that's we're doing two attacks about community.
For both.
You're new.
You are to use your action.
Yeah, I'm going to use my reaction for that.
Okay, a great point.
I forgot that that causes the fleas.
So yeah, that's that's that's all right.
All right.
Yeah, it's 17 plus 12.
And to do that.
Do that hits.
Yeah, I'm just saying, but I'm just saying the numbers.
All right, um, make them feel like if you want to use it on this,
if you fucking up.
Yeah, how does Bartik inspiration work?
So D8 now, is it?
It's D8 now.
Yeah.
You just eat your roll.
If you need it, if you need it, and no, I hit your attack.
Oh, you don't need it right now.
So I get to keep it.
All right, say the thing is, yeah.
All right.
So I got eight plus five, uh, plus nine.
I mean,
it's just with fire damage to him.
Yeah, it's with fire.
Just this is a bludgeon now.
It was just, yeah, it's a lot better than I thought it would.
That's right.
I don't know.
There's only two points.
All right, bludgeon damage.
Okay.
And, uh,
first, I think it's seven points of fire damage.
I'm going to go ahead and make use my battle master maneuver,
because I can use that any time I hit.
It's just, uh,
for the, for the, uh,
that's it.
No, it's going to be better.
And there come shedders to Old Bay.
Yeah, there's another D8.
I think you can't, please don't use Old Bay.
There's another student.
Yeah, it's just, all right.
So that's four more points of bludgeon damage.
And you need to make a,
that's the nice crab.
Yeah, yeah.
We have it.
Uh, actually, I'm going to use it as a maneuvering attack.
So, uh, the CLE can have,
fuck, does he need that now?
I'll do it as a trip attack.
I know it's stupid,
but see if he can pass a strength saving throw of 17.
Is this on the attack of after three?
Yeah, yeah.
He might not actually get to run away then, right?
Yeah, that would, that would be how it would be.
He would just try to run away.
Yeah, so it does fail,
which means I'll move him back.
And he's on now.
And a fire.
They don't like that.
It managed.
And just FYI,
Oracle, you could use, uh,
party information for saving throws.
Uh, it's, yeah, that's, that's, that's,
though, probably more important for you than, uh,
attack rules.
Yeah, yeah.
In fact, silly.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Plus 12.
Yeah, wow.
Okay, awesome.
That's it for the, is that the end of that turn?
Right, you're done.
Is he already used your action on the side?
Yeah.
And that was an attack property.
So now it's barcode's actual, actual term.
Fitch him.
Okay.
Uh, you're down by the way.
So I'm attacking with advantage.
All right.
Oh, eight plus 12.
So dirty 20.
Yeah, pitch.
All right.
What is that?
Uh,
well, that's, uh,
19 points of, uh,
bludgeoning damage.
Oh, bark.
I'm going to stop you before you finish and just ask you,
how do you kill it?
Uh, the, the fire, uh, from the hammer just, uh,
it starts to burn all of its skin, uh,
just start from the center.
I'm just hitting it right in the back while it's laying on the ground.
And, uh,
I feel like I've just delivered enough damage to it's root cage.
It just, it's spying chatters on you never.
Yeah.
It's like, kind of oddly good smelling barbecue.
So yeah, yeah, he won his dish on it.
It'll be done.
So I have marker cookies on here.
Uh, I'm going to move up to, uh,
the other yeti.
And I'm going to take my extra attack or whatever it's.
Yep.
All right.
Okay.
Yeah.
Get on the, uh,
yes, 16 plus 12.
Uh,
yeah, that's all we're going to do.
Maybe we'll win.
Oh, shit.
Uh, so that's for 16 points of
bludgeoning.
Okay.
And, uh, five points of fire damage.
Okay.
Uh, and I'll use another battle master.
To try and frighten it.
Anyway, uh,
17 wisdom saving throw.
Yeah.
Remember, what are you saying?
We're just going to have no problem.
I don't understand that.
All right.
So it's that's frightened of me.
And it also takes three more points of bludgeoning damage.
Yeah.
We can get these numbers down.
Um, okay.
Okay.
So what can attack you now?
Yeah.
How are you doing?
Health wise.
Hammer time.
So I could heal you if you need them.
You can.
Yeah.
Mistyly, you could,
how wise.
Yeah.
No, it's paper.
But what's the range on it?
It's just next to me.
It's a health.
It's a bonus action health feature from the in a hot.
All right.
So that's my turn.
Yep.
Okay.
So then to see what he's up.
Yep.
Okay.
So I'm getting the next.
I'm going to hack and slash at yet he numbered two.
Okay.
17.
That's the only one we know where it is.
The other one is likely somewhere in this channel.
All right, you cut out.
That is not a hit.
That's with your bonus.
Yep.
What's the pack?
What is this one?
All right.
I'll take my take my second.
My second attack.
You're clear to go through it.
Okay.
Yeah.
That's a 26.
I can get extra weight.
Five plus six.
So 11 slashing.
Okay.
Then I'll take my second attack.
That's 20.
Wonderful.
14, 7, 21, 27, 27 slashing.
Nice.
Now I'll hold on to that for now.
I'll be.
I'll stop there.
Okay.
The total.
Nice work.
What was it?
38.
I think so.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Oh, yes.
Okay.
Now it's the two in capacity to get these turns,
but I don't think there's anything they can do, right?
No, they actually don't get the same.
So they're just not we skip over the turns.
Sweet.
It's not a Schroffbar.
Thank you.
All right.
I'm going to move up to the van par we know about.
That's next to red.
Further.
Okay.
It's 35.
You got it.
So.
I really make it.
I will use my bonus action of Val vanity.
On that vampire.
So I have advantage.
Remix minute.
My bonus action.
I will attack with my long sword.
A radiant long sword.
I remember with my first sword attack.
That'll be a 27 to hit.
With this.
Sean, matter of record keeping the other vampire
that you hit, you did market with those hits, correct?
I don't think I did.
Okay, I don't think I did.
Okay.
I don't remember doing that if I did.
If anyone else, I don't want to call me out,
but I don't think I did.
Just reminding you to not forget that feature.
Um, that will be.
All right, let's look.
That'll be a nine points of slashing damage.
Plus, all right, that's better.
12 points of radiant damage.
Yes, so 21 points.
Essentially allow you to see what they are.
Even when they ban.
No, the, um, are you talking about the divine sense feature?
Ryan.
No, I'm talking about the sword.
Remember, it's got, so it does the radiant damage,
but also somebody and then it does a strike for every mark.
I don't think I will mark them.
Um, this, obviously, I will mark this person.
Thank you for that.
Just reminding you that feature might come and help
people where they are.
Yeah, good calling.
Does that show him where they are if they disappear?
No, but if they get hit by it, they'll react.
Yeah, no, it's, it's, I can use another, uh, basically a call of divine
strike on those that I mark.
So I'm going to assume I didn't mark the other person,
and I will mark this.
Did you get that damage, uh, Ron?
21.
Yes.
Yep.
Okay, cool.
And 12 of that was radiant.
So I'm going to do that again.
Um, attack at advantage.
Uh, that'll be another 20 step.
I will add a divine smite to this.
So that'll be an additional 2.8 on this 2.8.
So there we go.
We were going to slash your first.
So that'll be 14 slashing.
Okay.
That'll be.
Let's see.
Nine radiant from the sword and then from the smite.
That'll be nine additional points from the smite.
That's also radiant.
Yeah.
But I got 30.
Okay, 32.
We've got to.
This poor guy.
We're back to the top of the round.
The two vampires.
Yeah, so the dude, the dude that's in between you guys right now,
watching this chick get beat on, who's the vampires.
Like he's literally screaming and shitting his pants.
There's just so much like right matches of white.
There's so much.
So much.
Maybe.
Maybe.
Maybe.
Maybe.
Maybe.
Maybe.
Maybe.
Maybe.
Maybe.
Maybe.
Maybe.
Maybe.
Maybe.
Maybe.
Maybe.
Maybe.
Maybe.
Maybe.
Maybe.
Oh, sorry.
I got to move rough part.
Yeah.
We got to move.
I got to move.
I think he's.
Okay, so this is vampire one.
I thought vampire one was the one that disappeared.
It is.
Yes, okay.
Yeah.
Okay.
Where did you get here?
Interesting.
pop.
Give me just
solid. Yeah. That's a pretty solid. Yeah. And you can dip it in a notch.
It's always by the beard. Yeah. I know what they're like. Exactly.
It's like super fast in your imagination. Yeah.
That's marketing. He was an animal. So for me, you're marketing because they created this big stand
where they're like, some people call it boots and people are like flipping out.
That's just engaging. Yeah.
But all the like Pennsylvania's and they don't say like Pennsylvania Dutch people were like,
it is boots. What are we fucking talking about? What are we talking about?
All right. So you don't see where it comes from, but you do hear
thinkled on. Yeah. You hear a little crunching noise from inside of the crowd and you hear
some whispering in like what sounds like a magical sort of enchantment being uttered.
And suddenly absolute chaos breaks out in front of you from the group of people that are
just to the north of where Althea and Rothbard are. Wait, wait, wait. So like here within the zone.
Yes. Okay. No need a wisdom saving throw
from whatever doing it. Why? Because they're within my spirit guardians zone.
No, they're not. It's a ranged attack, but nice try. Oh.
You're the dick one, Ryan. It's not me. You're the mediator.
Can you tell us the spirit guardians? We don't have it like in a roll of money, but I can't see it.
Yes. All right. So give me a second. I got to roll some things.
Three. I love it. Yeah. What is it? What is it? What is it?
Oh, wait. Hold on a minute.
About to do 10. That's the wrong one.
The button crunchers.
The old bone grinder. The old bone grinder. Whatever happened.
The old bones. Funny. I was just right. That's good.
All right. So what ends up happening is as I said, chaos starts to unfold from the group of people
that are right in front of you. And about half of them run at the group and start making
attacks on them randomly. The other half run away in random directions.
I should be.
Because they have been inflicted with a condition called a spell called confusion.
And he's a bone kind of choosing the mob. So that is one, two, three, four, five, six,
seven, eight, and tax.
First one's a mess. Second one's a mess.
Yeah.
This one's a mess. This one's a hit.
This and a hit. So there's two hits out of there.
I'll fan Rothbard. You're going to take the hits because you're the closest.
And they will be with basically just a short sword that these people are holding.
Okay.
Where'd they get? Give them short hits.
Wow.
Wow.
These motherfuckers.
Well, that's so far.
Oh, man. You're going to take five points of damage in Rothbard.
You are taking nine, slashing damage.
This is a crazy. I had told guy from Belmstein.
All right.
I was thinking about the stabbing robot.
Okay. So that's the first thing you do.
A bit of poos cut out like that.
I'll start out more again.
Good play, but man, play, but
yeah.
So you're going to hate this.
Everybody gets like crit.
Should I?
Should we be concerned?
So from within the crowd, you do hear something that indicates a direction of where this stuff's
coming from. Do you hear this female scream in this voice?
They're attacking villagers.
And then a lightning bolt shoots out from the crowd and strikes everyone.
That is a little different than the lightning bolt that came from Cassini,
but it's still a lightning bolt.
Wait, hold on, hold on.
All right.
Got you.
All right.
So based off of where she is, I just measured this real quick.
I'll only hit one of you.
This is going to be aimed at Alphaya.
And actually, let me do something real quick guys.
Hang on.
It's going to hit Alphaya and Cassini.
It's all right.
Yeah.
Yeah.
So both of you need to make a
well-held DC.
A DC-18
or not Christmas, sorry, dexterity saving throw.
I have a thing called evasion, which is when I make a dexterity throw,
I take only half damage, and if I pass, it's don't take any damage.
Oh, that's 20.
Oh, wait, right, so you dodged it.
I got a total of a 16, so I fail.
Get a little bit out of the plus two.
Great.
So I don't think I have anything I can add to it.
You will take 29 damage from that attack,
and a bunch of villagers just get like roasted alive,
and it'll hit a straight line.
But it does give you an interesting point of view now.
Take the parts.
Well, you might know roughly where she is now.
I mean, we know the direction.
She's in at least.
We know she's not in the spirit guardians.
I will, I'll give you a little bit better than that,
is that you can see that it originated from,
so at this point, you would see her.
Yeah.
Yeah, she made a fall on attack, she's revealed herself.
Well, I mean, she was just in the crown,
she was hard to know what she was.
No, yeah, but when you make it attack,
unless we're giving them greater visibility,
and you're not giving them greater visibility.
Are we giving them greater visibility?
You can definitely know where all these people of Ampire
are in the case we wanted to use like a frostbite.
Definitely.
What does Shenzhen say?
They don't have greater visibility,
but they do have this ability to be able to even hold
with it well.
Where are you going to shoot through them?
I have a cool feature that,
that's an Ampire one.
She's done.
I'm worried about cover.
The second.
Who's up next?
Okay.
Thank you.
Don't do it.
If there are no obstacles.
Okay, by the way, I'm rolling,
I wrote concentration and I say,
so I can keep concentration and fall lightly.
Okay.
Is that so?
So I wrote 15 plus applied,
and then I needed a role of 15.
I can do a AOE, doesn't that sweet?
What?
If she's in the AOE,
call lightning does it mathematically?
So there's a giant cloud,
but I could just call from anywhere within that cloud
one bolt of lightning straight down.
Whenever you can.
And it hits everything that's within five feet of it.
And then my subsequent turn,
if I maintain concentration,
I can call down,
I can use my action to call down another lightning bolt
without having to use a spell.
Slow.
All right.
Ampire that's nearest to you,
emits, emits a scream.
All of you must give me a DC 18 wisdom saving throw.
Everyone?
All of us?
Everybody within a 30 foot radius of it.
Even if we're in the cyber system.
So it's just, it's a lot of fun.
And, and I'll say,
and I'll say,
there's questions for Andy.
Are you regarding doing anything to protect people?
No.
Okay.
So I still do a fucking speech.
Wisdom saving?
Yeah.
What did you say, Wisdom?
Wisdom saving throw.
Yeah, if I failed.
Okay.
One second.
This isn't Wisdom saving throw.
Uh, 30, 20.
You pass.
Yeah, there was an 18.
Okay, so that's pass.
I failed.
Okay, so we have two failures in a pass.
Yep.
All right.
A lot of say.
What are you?
I'm going to use inspiration to re-roll that out.
Right.
So another thing I was going to ask,
I have, I have uncanny Dodge,
which allows me to take to have the damage.
Is that?
I don't know, man.
It's a charity.
It's only for dexterity.
And Kenny Dodge says it for an attack.
Is that considered an attack?
Um, it's an effect rather than an attack.
So I wouldn't agree.
I would say that it's not.
Thank you.
Yeah, I think an attack is, I think the attacker has to make an attack or
where he was making us.
That sounds good.
Well, I mean that, yeah, technically,
because it's like iron balls and lightning bolts, you can dodge.
And that's saving throw.
Well, but those are dex saving throws or fireball is at least.
Right, but that's any.
Everybody that failed it is going to take 26.
I think damage.
It's all up.
Yeah, so.
It fills every single person that was a villager that was near you.
So they're all.
Okay.
I'm done.
It's pretty bad.
I'm at 17.
Oh, oh, no longer confused.
I mean, I can cast the heal.
I have to.
Yeah, but I have to break my concentration.
Well, not necessarily.
We use it to take a healing potion.
You next to them for yourself.
It's a bonus.
You're next to you, right?
I can use landhands on.
Yeah, hamsy.
He's not going to do.
All right.
Is that it for vampire two?
That's what I want to do for myself.
Yeah, I think that's done this.
All right.
The honor for you.
Anytime.
Excuse me.
It recharges up five or six.
Yeah, as as my bonus action.
I mean, move you.
I'm going to move my zone there.
I'm going to move further.
I assume I can move it like in 30 feet.
Yeah, I see these people.
I feel like protecting those people.
Problem with that.
No, okay.
I'm going to use shock.
I'm going to give the vampire the shocker.
Go for it.
Get it done.
Mayonnaise.
Bell attack.
16 plus eight.
So 24.
That hits.
That's which vampire?
The one.
Yeah, right here in the mix.
That hits.
They will.
Eight.
Six points of
Thunder damage.
Let me make sure.
No, it's landing damage.
Lighting damage.
Plus one.
Radiant.
From my radiant consumption.
Plus, the fact that they're in the range,
they will take an additional three points.
So four points.
Radiant.
Six points.
Lightning.
Okay, got it.
Let me see if there are any other effects.
It can't take reactions until the start of its next turn.
Interesting.
Oh, wait, wait, wait.
It's 2 to 8.
I'm sorry.
Okay.
And that's eight.
So it would be 14 points of lightning damage.
Four points of radiant damage.
No reactions.
I'm done.
Then it's my turn.
I'm going to use my action to call lightning again
from the same cloud.
And I'll do it in a sort of behind you ready too.
So it needs to make a DC 18 dexterity saving throw.
Fail.
Thank you.
Okay.
All right.
That's only a, that's 11 points.
That's 11 points of lightning damage.
Okay.
Pray for that yeti.
And then.
I'm going to move point to three.
Or.
Research.
No, we can.
To look across.
I'll be off there.
I'm going to be online with anybody.
I'll move there and then cast.
I'll use my bonus action to hit him with a.
Archer beam.
That will be.
No, that's a 19 to hit.
Does that hit the yeti?
Yes.
Got.
That will be 15 points of radiant damage.
15.
Okay.
And that's it for meeting.
So that brings us to that yeti.
All right.
That yeti is going to take a swing at Glorical.
That's a net 20.
Oh, that's.
Glad it didn't get me.
Does it?
Wait, wait, who.
That's all for anything.
I have my.
Okay, so Glorical.
That is.
A lot.
Give it to me, man.
That'll like he's a big boy.
29 points of slashing damage.
And five points of cold.
I'd like to use my reaction to do sentinel attack on him.
Okay.
Don't get to subtract two from the five called him.
Yep, yep, sweet.
Are you guys not going to be dumb?
You use it.
What was yours, Colin?
That was a 12.
Nope.
All right.
So that is going to make a second attack of a silly.
I'm going to use my woe to roll a D6 to subtract from his attack roll.
Oh, you're going to be really glad you did that.
I will see what it is.
It might only be no one.
It's a four.
So it was a 24.
But now it's a 18.
Wonderful.
Best.
Wait, what do you want to see?
Play three.
I'd just minus.
I had to roll it.
So it's a minus four.
So I think it's still missed though.
It was enough.
I knew it was going to be a
rough one of those.
Yet he's done.
I was in a comment.
So at the beginning of each day,
I roll if I get even like,
that's a little part of it.
Like it wades.
And I can either.
I need to be able to roll.
I added these six for the result for three times that day.
And the next morning,
the re-roll to see if you can possibly do it.
So right now, I can't do anything to any of your guys.
I'm just sure I'm going to keep it going.
So far as I'm supposed to use it before I know.
I'm going to use.
I'm going to do that.
Ampower with my crossbow.
I'm so close.
But I'm going to take a crossbow.
I'm going to use steady aim.
Take advantage on that.
Yes.
As long as I don't move,
I can get advantage on that y'all.
This is the one right next to you.
Yeah, one right in front of me.
Okay.
All right.
So that's a 2020.
Who did it?
Definitely.
All right.
Six points of
damage from that crossbow.
Is that magical or is that just a normal attack?
That is just.
That is that is magical from my magic river.
Yes.
The crossbow from magic.
Check it.
And then I get to do smooth attack.
12 more points of damage on the sneak attack.
That was seven and 12.
Yes.
Okay.
And then I will.
This engage using cunning action.
And just kind of move over here behind Rothbard.
Will you
action to do something different?
Just saying.
Oh, I can't take an attack of opportunity.
You're right.
You're right.
I'm going to use.
Yeah, I'm going to use.
I'm going to use my cunning action now.
Okay.
Move.
Yeah, you might move really right here.
You're just going to get.
I want to see within Rothbard's range because he's going to help me out.
Probably.
I'm going to roll or stealth.
I have to roll stealth when I do the high action, right?
9 plus 11.
That's a 30 20 on stealth.
What was your total?
I'm sorry.
It was a 30 20 on stealth.
Yeah, I mean, you're, you're hidden.
Okay.
I'm done.
It's boring.
I'm not going to go.
Okay.
Torian.
And the door needed all of break concentration.
That's the thing I would say.
I don't want to break concentration.
But honestly, I'm like, I'm just going to cast.
Doesn't it whispers again, but at level one?
Okay.
On yet and two.
I want to vote the same activity.
We'll be a DC 16 wisdom saving throw.
All right.
We'll be a D6 psychic.
Then you'll flee and provoke two attack of opportunity from Garco and Vasili.
All right.
So that will be 14 points.
Psychic damage.
Dude.
Okay.
Bitch.
Seventeen to hit for my opportunity.
Miss.
Jim.
Very glorified.
You're going hard.
Got it.
Can we just say?
30 30 30.
Thanks.
I'm doing 30.
Why are we rolling?
All right.
So you made me do this.
This is what you made me.
This is like, uh, so that's um.
Um.
Uh,
good.
What's the reason?
Uh, it's a more three.
It's a month.
Yeah. It's a.
It's a plus three.
Santa hammer.
Sorry.
What's the what's the most difficult?
I think it's plus.
Plus three.
So it's.
No.
That's great.
It's the problem now.
That's 21 points of bludgeoning.
Okay.
Two three.
And.
Eight points of fire damage.
Uh,
I think.
Right.
What's your strength?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
But it's doing now.
Is it disadvantage?
It makes sure you're getting your full points.
Just jealous that he's got a plus three.
Probably he probably has like a plus five screen.
Oh, no.
No, it plus six.
Hey, watch your fucking mouth.
Six.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
We didn't realize what we did until it was too late.
And that's why we're fighting for Yeti's and two vampires.
Yeah.
Well, I mean, get over everyone.
This is called.
So the Yeti is going to run this way.
It's still there.
We pass it yet.
Not here on something.
I'm going to.
I'm going to move.
Be closer to you.
Oracle.
Just like move up like 15.
Yeah.
I don't know.
Torian.
What you're moving towards Torian.
No, no, Torian is moving.
No, move them close to.
Yeah, that's right.
You got it.
You want to be right next to them?
No, no, no.
Can you move them?
I'm working on it.
I didn't know who was moving.
I was fighting.
For Torian.
The water looking question.
Yeah, let's get board of inspiration to.
Me.
I'm going to be.
I'm going to be.
I'm going to be.
So wait here.
Right.
The only one that survives this encounter.
It's.
Really weird.
We're sacrificed for the safer off.
Sorry, you're going to roll new care here.
What a will and test.
He was over half age.
But you thought it was a good idea.
Hey, man.
You also.
Weirdly you even gave him a BJ before you passed out.
It's my last dying breath.
Marco, it's your turn.
Alright, so.
I'm going to just chase after that one and.
I'm always you.
Yeah.
Yeah, so I'm going to move up on it.
Tell it.
I was with.
I was thinking.
Yeah, 13 plus 12.
You're.
I'm.
Half of the empire.
Let's see.
What's happening?
Oh.
22.
My brain froze.
22 points of.
I think that's true.
That's.
Think about that.
And then six points of fire damage.
Okay.
And then I'm going to.
Attack again.
Looking real bad.
Yeah.
Yeah, 19.
18.
18 points of.
Ludging.
How do you kill it?
I.
As it's running away.
I just.
Hammer into its big old Yeti booty that's exposed.
Because.
I'm.
I'm.
I'm.
I'm.
I'm.
I'm.
I'm.
Yeah.
I asked.
All right.
I did movement.
I did.
No bodies around for bonus action.
All right.
All right.
All right.
Let's see.
Don't know where the other one is, right?
It's back here.
Oh, can you get that?
Yeah.
Let me just run right over there.
I'm going to move.
On this way.
I will take a shot at.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I think.
I think.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's just wetter on that bag.
Okay.
So.
You know, you know.
24 to hit.
I was a bitch. I got it. It's like podcast and a bit point scheme and stuff.
Yeah. And then you need fart. Oh, no, whoa. Okay. Just watch something.
Everything is fucking falling apart. It's only a matter of four. It's
to keep us all in real real quick. Yeah. So that'll be 10 point total for
two. Well, she's under LCC investment. That's my weekend. Got it. Who is it?
Can you hear me? Oh, the ceiling. Yes. And then I'm just taking a
tack. I'll reload the heavy crossbow. Hey, I'm with that dude.
He's under investigation for the Bitcoin second. Yeah, for fart coin.
Yeah. Oh, tell me. Because she pumped it. Well, yeah. Her story is that she
didn't just promoting a coin. Well, I'm sure she didn't know where it was
happened. Because she's. I agree. As Jostlin didn't know.
That anything in her life.
We don't all the time. You got to spin on it. And last
year's the most manipulative and creative person ever. But she doesn't come off
as that, you know, it doesn't take a rocket science to be like, guys like it
when you spit on their dick. Also, she has even those infuriating
and listen to boy. That's fine. We didn't mark it a financial
product with that concept. I'm not. But like we have
different odds between them out. We're doing it for
two years. No, I had to reload my time. Okay. All right.
Yeah. You're like, you're like, you're like, you're like, you're like...
All right. Oh, uh, like a squeaky dog toy fan.
It doesn't fucking work for me. Tell them out.
About. I'll put it out. We don't kinkshade in there.
It's a very good time. All right. So we skip over yet.
And get a drop by.
Sorry. You burned yourself a purity seal.
You're paladin. Gosh.
Neighborhood baladin, you're...
We do need purity seals for real. No, get your own. I got my
leg right here.
The vampire in front of me. I'm going to hit with my sword. I'm still in
advantage. Yeah. I think I have a one in a 19.
I'll take 19. So I'll do. I will add smite to this.
So I will see that'll be 10 slashing and that'll be
three radiant and there'll be another five radiant.
And then I'll do that again with my sword.
Not expensive either. No. No.
No, I think that's a company. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
So that will be, let's see, 23 to hit.
Okay.
The D20s are obviously slashing and four radiant.
That's all I can do. Oh, use my bonus action to lay on
hands on Althea for 20 hit points.
Yeah. So hands off Althea. Which is half of my ray on
in your spool. A lot of them have cats on the D20s
bounce. That's the thing I got for Rob cats.
So Rob cats and we're only one.
I mean, she can do a lot back. Yeah. You know that.
You know, let me tell you. Okay. So vampires, the vampires are
up.
The one. The vampire one goes first.
Last campaign. They're like, uh, me and three tentacles on one line.
One goes first. Okay. So one.
Yeah. You guys have the July on speed.
Yeah. What is not in any like spell effect area right now? Is she?
No. Uh, which one? Oh, you need to. Oh, neither of them are either right.
Okay. Oh, okay. Is this in? Yeah, range.
So, um, hang on guys.
Give me just a sec.
The second part of the M2 is based on a damage.
Band two and for me, it's taken an ass time. I know. I know. I've nice.
I got a nice sound, but you know, I'll let other one probably.
I'll put it to one. I mean, I would generate it.
It's a bit calling, um, brutal mouth.
I'm thinking.
They also pull him off.
You watch the Minecraft, but yeah, there was a bad barrier.
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.
Nothing in this. You know, I listen to 30 minutes of.
I'm explaining the Minecraft.
Oh, baby to me.
I don't care. I can't.
It's got enough like. Yeah, I can.
It's good. Okay.
Got some 80s. It's got enough 80s vibes.
Like, you know, it's great.
Comedic relief.
If Jack Black.
I don't know. If you hate Jack Black, then I can understand it.
Yeah, that was. That was a weird thing.
It's the 80s.
That's why I like it.
Like, just like, you know, the.
Uh, the original.
Oh, it's not a level that.
So if I have to do it to the 4th, I can.
What if it's just for shaking? Okay.
Fuck you. All right.
I'm asking a person.
I don't know.
Is that like an analog?
So.
What are you casting Ryan?
Hold person.
Fuck on who?
You on, uh, on rat on rat.
Rothbard and Alphaea.
Technically, they're not people.
Do we make, uh, is there a state for it?
It's true.
Rothbard is undead.
Oh, I can't.
Can I not hold you?
Are you immune to that status?
Technically, I'm a teenager.
So I'm not fully fledged human.
It's a new research.
And if you hold him like that, you'll give him an erection.
Yeah, I like.
I don't pay taxes.
He's not.
He's not.
I'm a little bit.
I'm sure you're a little bit.
I'm sure you're the one who tagged or reported by a old person.
And when that is now.
Nice.
So does it not be affected by this?
A spell can affect undead.
Yeah, well, well, that's.
Nice.
Are you fully undead, though?
Yes, I think you've been undead enough that it counts you.
All right, that's fine.
I don't, I don't eat.
I don't have to breathe.
You guys are going to have to poop.
I have to breathe.
I have to breathe.
I have to breathe.
That's fine.
He doesn't have to breathe.
He shouldn't have to breathe.
He shouldn't have to breathe.
He doesn't have to breathe.
Yeah, yeah.
All right.
So Joe is the three.
So, um, Vasili and I'm sorry.
I'll fade in right here.
You guys hear me?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's wild.
It's formally undead.
And it does not work in undead.
It's crazy.
Awesome.
Yeah.
That's a follow for me.
I don't have anything to add to it.
It would be meaningful.
I mean, I'm held in place.
It doesn't deactivate any of my ongoing effects.
Yeah.
Yeah.
You're paralyzed.
Concentrate.
Yeah.
Wait, I didn't ask this.
Me being and visiting me being hidden.
Did not matter.
That's a good.
Targeted.
So that what you can switch targets.
All right.
So then I'm changing the target.
Now, Vasili, you're under attack.
Instead of alphas because I couldn't have attacked her.
I didn't know.
You can't even.
I'm changing it right now.
That's.
It doesn't affect concentration.
I'm sorry.
I'm here.
I guess I'm just holding one person.
Okay.
Hold tight, baby.
Time.
It is a.
I haven't.
I haven't been held by ladies.
All right, so, um, concentration at least she's then going to turn and make a bite attack
at Rad who is being held, which of course he will make, will mean that he rolls pretty
much.
But I think when you get you get to try and save against it, well, the the cloak wouldn't
would give her disadventing.
Right, so this is a straight roll, that's fair, let's see how bad that is, straight roll,
she's going to hit with a 22, does that hit?
That's exactly my armor class, who yes, that's why I think it's sort of 22 or so, we
are going to get, oh no, it does very much change the way that you play, oh my gosh, Ryan,
you're going to take six points of piercing damage, plus 18 points of necrotic, oh, okay,
I'm resistant to necrotic, oh yeah, you have the ring, don't you, I don't know, this
is just being an amazement, oh cool, so she doesn't like the taste of your blood, you know,
this tastes like, I take half of the necrotic and that because of that, she's only regaining
half of the hit points she would have gone, so it was six points, you're saying eight, you
would have had eight, six points of, so you had six points of piercing and another, it would
be eight points of necrotic instead of 16, okay, you take a radiant damage, it's not
regeneration, this is a different blood, this is a healing detection, all right, so she's
done that and then as her last thing that she's going to do as a free, as a ant will, she
will miss the step away from the group, okay, do we see where she goes, yes, all right, so my
concentration is broken, that's correct, that is, yeah, yes, okay, so this goes away, well,
you get the role for it still, don't you, yeah, you would roll, okay, you tell us if you're
professional, okay, yeah, David's saying that being, like, a whole person is equal, is
equivalent to incapacitated, I mean, the incapacitated is one of the conditions of being
paralyzed, yes, there are creatures incapacitated, okay, and then on page 203 of the player's handbook,
it says lose concentration if you are incapacitated or dying, so concentration broken, hey, oh, I was
protecting the dead guys, what's spirit, spirit, a little flappy dude, yeah, we're little flappy
dudes, they were stately angelic creatures, you heathen, yeah, I love flappy, I really see, that's
cool, now I can start using spells again, oh, once I get out of feeding, I mean, I like
being a miss of mommy's touch, you know, sometimes, if it's a good boy, yeah, she's a hot
mommy, okay, is that it for the vampires? Well, that was vampire, wait, that was two, one already
did it turn, so we're good, right? Okay, so now it's your turn, yeah, yeah, so it's another
will save to get out, yeah, hey guys, yep, I need to be honest with me, so I started off that turn
thinking about vampire one, and then I think that I did actions for vampire two, but I don't think
I did actions for vampire one, yeah, I was I was taking a pee break, I don't know, I don't think she
did anything, yeah, yeah, no, I don't think yeah, actions for more villagers, I guess,
yeah, she's probably gonna, hey, go a sec, let me finish up her actions for quick,
oh no, I made it, why could I do it, I will definitely,
yeah,
poster, with two teams, so I'm going to be 13, oh 2d4,
yeah, it's only one of the MPHR,
So she is going to make a different ice and I got a figure out what she can still do.
What do you want?
What do you want?
You are going to move up one and she is going to attack with lightning bolt.
And it is going to hit Rothbard, Viselli and the Yeti, the third Yeti.
I am sorry, fourth.
There we go.
It is going to awaken.
Did you have one more problem?
What are your major activities?
Okay.
We get to see.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
It's going right.
We've got a lot of like a sewer.
Does the city fail or past?
Pass.
I feel here.
I mean,
fine.
Like,
24.
Okay, now I'm.
I guess.
That kills both the villagers next to her that aren't aligned to you guys.
I'm okay.
No kidding.
Yeah.
That's the.
And the.
Yeah.
Whatever.
People that think I'm crazy.
The Yeti automatically fails, right?
Or what?
He takes damage either.
Yeah.
We're just the kind of guy that would resolve a positive situation with a hand grenade.
Yeah.
That Yeti.
Honestly, I didn't do it just to wake the Yeti up.
I thought it wasn't going to hit until I measured.
But.
She, uh, she lined it up to hit both of you.
It wasn't about the Yeti.
So.
I'm not just being a dick.
The guy is a problem.
The Yeti and Circumstantial.
Happy.
It's a circumstantial Yeti.
We've all been there.
Once in a while.
Hey, she softened it up for you.
Yeah.
Yeah.
When you got a point, you got a point.
Take the red.
The killer.
It's called lateral damage.
Oh.
I feel bad about it.
But.
Very.
That.
I gave it, but I love it.
You're getting pretty.
You.
It's great.
Yeah.
What is a bag of the black.
Yeah.
Yeah.
You're back.
I felt.
It was in the forest when you ran out.
So.
So weird.
It felt like that was my voice crying out in the silence.
That's almost red.
Do.
We need a, we need like a.
guys are we good I'll take a break yeah that's the end is that the end of it
the vampires turns now let's hope so no no no you need you you need to go
like yeah that is the end of return okay please serve me to have another the
one for charge all right Ryan I don't think I want to have a full bunch of
turns in around yeah we're not in a good spot right yeah I mean the only
far off enough that the only good thing about it that it probably took a
decent what was the road you know everybody what what damage you got it's
probably decent I don't know how many hitboxes yeah I might still attack
I just want to know that it's awake I might attack
I'm going to kill yeah I mean I'm going to beat the shit out of them yeah so
maybe we sit really think we should yeah I'm valid there's so far away I
can't I mean I would have to use a mist to give a range of a range spell I can
do crossbow you have a good crossbow no I don't I mean that weapons are not
generally gonna be most efficient thing for me to do I don't even have to get
I have good on crossbows because I have crossbow feet I mean the cross
and sharpshooter feet so I don't worry about you know too late of the distance so I'm
really thinking there's a little bit but any reload every right about me for
sharpshooter it doesn't say I reload but it but maybe that's crossbow
expert it ignores a range you still have a range of roles roles on
range one cool thing I've never done with the sharpshooter feet you can choose to
take a minus five penalty to the attack roll and you get to add plus 10 to the
advantage and if I don't move can you study aimed roll at advantage therefore
a three-decent chance of hitting even with taking minus five yeah I've never
done it but it's mostly like a gamble you know that's kind of fun
yeah like that would be plus 10
grand and me and you so rad me you
and then Torian and Gargoyle to see lane
and a lot of turns until they go to the end I know yeah like I don't know
anybody can get to within melee range of them right now
I hope that they're not gonna move again I mean they're there until their turn
one until their turn yeah yeah so either that's starting getting too good
I mean if he wants to Sean with Rothbard could
isty stuck and then use the rest of his movement to get to them I think
that would be his return well he could misty steps above its action oh isn't
so he could use his bonus action it's a great your action there you go
uh i'd be like oh
and back to the end
how long you lived uh in the south off on the sunset ladies
but and you lived and you saw before I was
sorry I was going to go and you go back there and
I'm a little bit faster I should go with ice
I mean that was your dad's from
so you could move that if you wanted
yeah but maybe it's a scene of Northern Ireland
not fast you said and like uncle moves it and it's something like another guy
hopefully um like what don't you just sit down
uh that was the first time I'll finish the work
I'm just like what I did engineer the banks
I did engineering I had no tear to work for uh
terex they do genie like the little blue
people lifts okay yeah I was an engineer for them
he's just for a couple years and then the and then COVID shut down the
facility so um riot actually
queued me into a job over at mfg he said hey you know your process guy
okay sorry Craig do you have a minute uh the banking
banks
uh no yeah no I'm sorry I'm not in banking
I don't have a better job I know that's yeah that's
um number one suit
that's my my my my friend is for me I don't have a vast yet
I was like he won't own a three pc like I've got three this
yeah you gotta find a review yeah you gotta get that
I'm gonna find me like you know that's man like branded
yeah I've got like branded terex tether you ace yeah you would
add in your reviews like you have uh
nobody told me to do that for pieces you have
beyond three because there are apparently more
pieces than that indicates an extra zero in your income bracket
yeah yeah yeah
the bot is like plus and
and
that's the reason you know you don't need to
go buy the one suit it's just because the king of the
good
yeah
well follow
oh yeah
yeah you're wearing like your grass yeah and like
you know like a three pcs or four more yeah and you've got like a you've got
like the under like blouse you feel like once you're in that range and it's
not your wedding it's like you make more money than I know how to comprehend
this yeah yeah yeah yeah
that was fast really
and he's made a real good guy
you have that like a Shakespeare you may or may not have swandered it
yeah he's a man really
I mean it's a different one
it's a different one
well I'm thinking like David Bowie back up there I'm really
color
okay nice
all right guys
all right
me
all right uh we'll save to get
that's worse than
yeah uh do you use the product
inspiration that you've got do you want to have water from spring
oh no you have to have the article in myself
I give it
yeah I have it
forum
yeah yeah
but do you see that we're inspired by that
bardic
I'm assuming that being in capacity or
capacity of a full person
I rating consumption also inspires
it sounds it sounded that way yeah probably okay
or what rating consumption it's just say racial
and that I have that takes concentration
doesn't make you up to concentrate
you know the things
it's clear
so that's it for you
okay so it's my turn now
I'm going to call the lightning down next to
yeti that was already awakened so he needs to make a DC
18-18 or 17-dexterity saving throw
fail
okay
you want to
yeah this ability man
all right uh there'll be 20 points of lightning damage to him
and then how many use that's not a noise
this is how many use a bonus action to take a health
it's a chair
or
I got it written down
I need to do the expositives
oh I'm going to get it on the back
I'm going to get it on the back
I'm going to move a little bit
and I'm going to be like
I can also grapple
should I be like when we
when I do the clock yeah there's the best
let's go
air okay sorry I'm just trying to figure out
where we have oh no you're ready to line there
yeah you turned yourself into like a snuggler player you're like oh
I can't line that with love
yeah
hey man you're going to play the geometry
hey wait wait so did your archer shoot the the Yeti as well
I used my bonus action to take a health potion instead of shooting my archer being
got it okay yeah
all right
I don't think I could uh from over there I couldn't hit him anyway without
going through the one that's still in just a little bit
do you recharge every time
I'm assuming I do not well wait okay
yeah so these people in my way right here if I want to shoot across bed
um well three if I use I have the short shooter for you
oh that means that my weapons ignore half and three quarter cover
does that mean that I can shoot around them
yeah yeah does yes does okay
I mean you just punch right through
and I'm so good and also because of the sharp shooter feed I
it doesn't matter that it's like longer than 30 feet I can shoot
and I don't lose yeah I don't lose my
so I'm going to do I'm going to combine the sharp shooter feed with steady aim
which means I also get advantage on my role as long as I don't move
so I'm aiming for putting on of his vamp one or vamp two but it's the one
that's like is advantage can you sneak it back to you can't
yes it's further down or further up
I want this further down okay that's one
okay one for that one you can more damage
it's the magical quiver crossbow got it
all right so that's a 19 to hit that matches
all right so hit the hit points on that will be
there one a six six hit points on that
and then I will roll the sneak attack
and that is 19 12 more points on the sneak attack all right
okay there we go and I will use my cunning action again to hide
so I will roll stealth for that and that's a 22 on stealth
yeah all right so I'm going to stay hit for anytime
well is not looking great
so if I were looking at her she's less beautiful now and more
and lipstick and looking like a like a giant
bat variance of some sort that's the same to me
yeah I still appreciate the contact from a
well Celia's going to do
all right
okay so I'm still being told she's still banging looking but you
probably wouldn't want a B.J. anymore
no kingshaming
all right so Torian I'm going to move him here
I'm going to cast aid on you red
awesome on you alphia and on myself
so that's five surprise surprise that's five hit points
for us three and then I will give you a bardic inspiration
oh yeah this aid also
okay that's something does that get people
I'm going to read it for a point to move
and read it for like you get you get to move like
immediately you can miss out of your spell bolsters your allies with
toughest and resolve choose up to three creatures with
and range each target's hit point max and
and current hit points increased by five for the
tradition that's it
yeah what it's felt still take
I know this is already one hundred ten times
don't cry okay that's uh
thank you yeah because these yeties are waking up boys
I'm very sorry because it's just increasing your max
it gives yeah but it's still yeah you can
breathe a point
you can heal the higher okay uh barcode you're
I'm awesome uh I'm going to move uh
up to here
please wait I'll try to move up
but I'm just gonna capture like the
barb shot with the heavy current
yeah uh now I'm going to cast a blast
on uh myself and rad and Rothbard
so that's a plus a d4 to uh
saving throws because I'm scared the rad is
killed and I haven't been doing my bodyguard duties
and I went a little carefully or there so
does does Torrin need uh health
no okay uh and that's my turn
you can add plus if I need that you got one
three you've got a d4 you know yeah that should be
yeah you and you can you add that d4 every single time until I
lose or uh concentration okay that's only
to saving throws no it's attack rolls
uh and saving throws
it's attack all right it's not the attack
the most important we reaction we are
going to work yeah let's keep hitting the
hard
um okay so I'll move another
is that one it's in five oh you'll remember the yeti behind us
you have a plus five bonus to be seen on a mat at week
oh so I just got touched by a lady I don't need all of my uncles around
I'm so excited you okay um I'm going to take a shot at vamp one
I think that is it you can just do
with it does it's over 20
what was it to which like 24 or something shot the vamp one
yeah any crossbow normal it's more dead yeah whichever one's more
like uh the the vampire you just shot at is going to use
shield as a reaction and you miss
all right um in that case
I'll use my I'm going to attack to reload again
oh yeah I'm done now it's yeti four so yeti three is still
incapacitated and yeti four is about now oh boy
oh boy oh what's the movement
move moved move move move move move move move move move move
hi i have no idea oh no idea
sure new greenish
all right so the yeti charges at torillhead who's the only one that
can rage right now
We have the backwards. Sorry. This one's labeled as three ignore that. You guys can't see that. I'll keep track of it.
I thought you said ignore that. I mean, we can switch it now. It doesn't really matter to us. I don't think.
That's good to do this. That's good. Do you want to have them switcher? Do you want to switch it? I'm doing it.
Hang on. I just have them backwards on here, but I was playing them the way you guys were describing it.
So we have. Right. So at Torian.
This is not a good way though.
Okay. This is 10 to 8.
Oh, no, I have those. So Torian needs to make a DC 18 Constitution saving throw.
Oh, okay.
18.
That's past.
No fail. He passed. Yeah.
Wow. Okay. So you are immune to the chilling gaze of this creature and you take no damage from it.
It will then for its second movement, it will do a flaw attack, which it misses the first one.
And it misses the second one. You're lucky. That was the luckiest round.
You just just with the air. What does he use groggy?
That could have been really bad.
I was worried for round. Okay. You have a cold. That's it for his turn, right?
He's done. Yeah, I brought for it.
And that bless. By the way, you have four rounds left of that spell.
Just so you know, which the one's holding the other yeti.
I'm going to hands on myself.
