# Illustration Style Guide for Vellynne Harpell's Correspondence

## Overall Art Direction
Create a cohesive set of illustrations that appear to be from Vellynne Harpell's research notes. All illustrations should maintain a consistent medieval academic aesthetic while varying slightly based on their specific purpose.

## Technical Specifications
- Format: Square or slightly rectangular (4:3 ratio)
- Resolution: 2000x2000px minimum
- Color Palette: Limited palette focusing on sepia tones, faded inks, and aged parchment
- Text: Include handwritten annotations in a consistent script style

## Common Elements Across All Illustrations
- Aged parchment background texture (varying from light cream to darker tan)
- Ink that appears slightly faded in places
- Small ink splatters or smudges for authenticity
- Vellynne's personal sigil (a small raven with a staff) in bottom corner
- Consistent handwriting style for annotations
- Academic numbering system for notes (e.g., Fig. 1.2, Note A, etc.)

## Specific Style Guidelines by Illustration Type

### 1. "Vampire Bride Anatomical Study"
- **Reference Style**: Leonardo da Vinci's anatomical drawings
- **Line Quality**: Fine, precise pen lines with cross-hatching for shading
- **Layout**: Central figure with radiating annotation lines
- **Special Elements**: 
  - Mirror-image writing for secret notes (like da Vinci)
  - Small magical diagrams showing charm effects
  - Red ink highlights for vulnerabilities
  - Detailed facial features showing vampiric traits
  - Margin notes with observations on behavior

### 2. "Elder Vampire Influence Diagram"
- **Reference Style**: Medieval occult diagrams and early astronomical charts
- **Line Quality**: Slightly trembling lines suggesting ancient origin
- **Layout**: Hierarchical structure with Elder at top, brides below
- **Special Elements**:
  - Arcane symbols at connection points
  - Faded concentric circles suggesting magical influence
  - Small illustrations of eyes representing scrying capabilities
  - Darker ink for powerful connections, lighter for weaker ones
  - Small skull motifs indicating danger levels
- **Key Conclusion**: Diagram clearly illustrates how the Elder exerts control over brides and how disrupting specific connections could weaken the entire network. The diagram should emphasize that these connections are magical (not psionic) in nature, with a clear hypothesis that dispel magic or similar countermeasures may break these connections.

### 3. "Yeti Combat Tactics"
- **Reference Style**: Military field sketches and naturalist drawings
- **Line Quality**: Quick, confident strokes suggesting battlefield conditions
- **Layout**: Top-down tactical view with inset anatomical details
- **Special Elements**:
  - Directional arrows showing movement patterns
  - Small figure representing Glarkul with weapon raised
  - Anatomical insets highlighting vulnerable points
  - Frost effects around yeti figures
  - Tactical annotations with distance measurements

### 4. "Silvered Oil Application Diagram"
- **Reference Style**: Alchemical instruction manuals and apothecary guides
- **Line Quality**: Clean, precise lines for clarity
- **Layout**: Step-by-step process with numbered instructions
- **Special Elements**:
  - Detailed weapon cross-section
  - Droplet illustrations showing proper application amount
  - Small vial drawing matching the enclosed item
  - Timing indicators for effectiveness duration
  - Warning symbols for improper application

## Text Content Guidelines
- Use a mix of common language and arcane terminology
- Include at least one subtle joke or pun in each illustration
- Maintain Vellynne's slightly condescending academic tone
- Include references to "Blackstaff Academy research" or "according to my studies"
- Add small personal observations that reveal Vellynne's character

## Production Notes
- Create base illustrations in black ink style first
- Add color washes and aging effects as separate layers
- Ensure all text is legible when printed at 8x10 inches
- Test readability of smallest annotations
- Save in layered format for potential future modifications
