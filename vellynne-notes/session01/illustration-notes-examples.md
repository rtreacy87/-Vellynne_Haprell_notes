# Example Annotation Notes for Vellynne's Illustrations

## Note B: Light Intensity and Vampire Tissue Damage
"According to my experiments at Blackstaff Academy (conducted with appropriate ethical oversight, naturally), vampire tissue begins to show cellular degradation at approximately 85 candlemarks of focused light. Sunlight averages 100+ candlemarks at midday in temperate regions, explaining its effectiveness. Standard Light cantrips (15-20 candlemarks) prove insufficient, while Daylight spells (120+ candlemarks) exceed the necessary threshold. Interestingly, the radiant damage from divine magic appears effective at much lower light intensities, suggesting the wavelength rather than brightness is the critical factor. Further research required to determine precise spectral sensitivities."

## Note C: Silver Concentration Efficacy Analysis
"Silver concentration must exceed 92% purity to effectively disrupt the regenerative capabilities of lycanthropes and vampires. Common silver jewelry (typically 80-85% pure) proves inadequate, explaining frequent failures in folklore remedies. My metallurgical analysis indicates that silver's effectiveness correlates exponentially rather than linearly with purity—92% is merely 8% more pure than 84%, yet approximately 300% more effective. The silvered oil enclosed with this letter contains 98.3% pure silver in colloidal suspension (a significant improvement over the 94.7% standard taught at Blackstaff). Note that effectiveness diminishes after 4-6 hours of application as silver particles oxidize when exposed to air."

## Note D: Comparative Analysis of Holy Water by Divine Source
"Contrary to popular belief, holy water efficacy varies significantly based on the deity whose clerics consecrate it. Water blessed by clerics of Lathander (god of dawn) shows 27% greater effectiveness against undead than the baseline. Selûne's clerics produce holy water with superior effectiveness against lycanthropes (+32%), while Kelemvor's clerics create water particularly potent against incorporeal undead (+41%). Most surprisingly, holy water consecrated by clerics of Ilmater (god of endurance) shows reduced immediate damage but extended duration effects. Tyr's clerics produce the most consistent results across all undead types. Tempus-blessed water shows minimal variation in effectiveness regardless of the undead's original cause of death—a curious finding that warrants further investigation."
